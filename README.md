# NBA-Game-Outcome-Prediction-Project

This repository contains code for predicting the outcomes of NBA games using machine learning techniques. The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a team will win or lose a basketball game based on various features.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (>= 3.6)
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nba-game-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd nba-game-prediction
Run the Python script to execute the code:
bash
Copy code
python nba_prediction.py
Code Overview
The code in nba_prediction.py performs the following steps:

Imports necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn modules.
Reads the NBA game data from the 'nba_games.csv' file.
Preprocesses the data, including sorting, resetting the index, and removing unnecessary columns.
Defines a function to add a 'target' column indicating whether the team won the next game.
Handles missing values and converts target values to integers.
Performs feature selection using the Sequential Feature Selector and a Ridge Classifier.
Scales the selected features using MinMaxScaler.
Defines a function to perform time-based backtesting of the model.
Iterates through seasons to train and test the model using backtesting.
Calculates accuracy for the predictions.
Implements additional data preprocessing steps, such as rolling averages and shifting columns.
Merges the transformed data with shifted columns.
Performs feature selection and backtesting on the extended dataset.
Calculates accuracy for the extended model predictions.
Results
The accuracy of the predictive model for both the initial and extended dataset is calculated using time-based backtesting. The final accuracy values are displayed in the script's output.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for predicting NBA game outcomes. The code provided can be further extended and customized to improve model performance, experiment with different algorithms, and explore additional features for better predictions.

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the code, exploring alternative algorithms, or sharing insights about the NBA game prediction task.

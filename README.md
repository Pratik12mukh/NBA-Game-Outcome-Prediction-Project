## Introduction
In this project, we use historical NBA game data to train a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a team winning a game. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries and tools:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn


## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the NBA game data CSV file and place it in the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `NBA_Game_Prediction.ipynb` to see the detailed code and analysis.

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The NBA game data is loaded using pandas, and preprocessing steps include sorting, removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and scaling features.
2. Feature Selection: SequentialFeatureSelector is used to select relevant features for predicting game outcomes.
3. Model Training: RidgeClassifier is trained on the selected features to predict game outcomes.
4. Backtesting: The model is tested on historical data using a time series cross-validation approach.
5. Rolling Averages: Rolling averages of team performance metrics are computed and incorporated into the model.
6. Shifted Columns: Additional features are created by shifting relevant columns to capture previous game data.
7. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores.

## Results
The trained model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score here] on the test data. This indicates that the model is capable of predicting NBA game outcomes with a reasonable level of accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict NBA game outcomes. While the current model shows promising results, further optimization and exploration of other algorithms could potentially improve its accuracy.
